      <description>Course description These lectures will introduce the metaphysics of causation (or causality, or cause and effect). After a brief introduction to the topic, and some historical background, we will consider the concept of causal necessity and then look at David Hume’s view of causation, followed by David Lewis’s counterfactual theory, and the main objections to it.

      <title>Mind and Matter</title>

      <description>Course description These lectures will introduce the mind-body problem: the problem of the relation between mind and matter, or mind and body. We will consider the nature of mental life and physical processes, and the competing doctrines of dualism and materialism/physicalism. The nature of mind poses a dilemma for philosophy. If the mind is not physical, then how can it have effects in the physical world? But if the mind is physical, then how can we explain consciousness?</description>

      <title>Mind Dependence</title>

      <description>Course description In this course we will consider how philosophers have defended the mind-dependence of some or all objects of experience. In its most extreme forms, such defences of mind-dependence result in Idealistic views about the nature of reality as we know it. But the more widely accepted distinction between primary and secondary qualities of experience equally reduces important features of the world to mere modifications of mind or experience.</description>
