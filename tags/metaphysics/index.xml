Where and when Friday 10-11. Lecture Block Room 1.
Lecture 1: Hume and the problem of induction In this lecture I introduce the idea of induction, and discuss David Hume&amp;rsquo;s problem of induction.

      <description>Course description The relation between causes and effects is typically taken to have a direction (it&amp;rsquo;s asymmetric). Whenever C is a cause of E, then E is not a cause of C. Moreover, this directionality seems aligned with both the temporal arrow and with patterns of practical deliberation. How do we explain this feature? Not all philosophical analyses of causation capture the concept of causal direction in the same way, if they capture it at all.</description>

      <description>Course description These four lectures will discuss Michael Dummett&amp;rsquo;s and Hilary Putnam&amp;rsquo;s objections to metaphysical realism.
Where and when Weeks 1-4, Friday 10-11, Lecture Block Room 7
Lecture 1: Realism This lecture introduces the discussion about realism. We can distinguish three forms realism can take: metaphysical, epistemological, and semantic. Metaphysical realism has been criticised from an epistemological angle by idealist philosophers. Semantic realism has been the target of recent discussions.</description>

      <description>Course description These lectures will introduce the metaphysics of causation (or causality, or cause and effect). After a brief introduction to the topic, and some historical background, we will consider the concept of causal necessity and then look at David Hume’s view of causation, followed by David Lewis’s counterfactual theory, and the main objections to it.

Course description The relation between causes and effects is typically taken to be asymmetric. Whenever C is a cause of E, then E is not a cause of C. But how do we explain this feature? What kind of asymmetry is this? Not all philosophical analyses of causation capture the concept of causal asymmetry equally well.</description>

      <title>Mind and Matter</title>

      <description>Course description These lectures will introduce the mind-body problem: the problem of the relation between mind and matter, or mind and body. We will consider the nature of mental life and physical processes, and the competing doctrines of dualism and materialism/physicalism. The nature of mind poses a dilemma for philosophy. If the mind is not physical, then how can it have effects in the physical world? But if the mind is physical, then how can we explain consciousness?</description>

      <title>Mind Dependence</title>
      <link>http://msteenhagen.github.io/teaching/2016mde/</link>

      <description>Course description In this course we will consider how philosophers have defended the mind-dependence of some or all objects of experience. In its most extreme forms, such defences of mind-dependence result in Idealistic views about the nature of reality as we know it. But the more widely accepted distinction between primary and secondary qualities of experience equally reduces important features of the world to mere modifications of mind or experience.</description>

      <description>Course description These four lectures will consider the nature and persistence of persons over time. A particular focus will be on the recent debate about Animalism. The lectures will cover the Part 2 syllabus materials on Persons for the paper on Metaphysics. Feel free to contact me at ms2416@cam.ac.uk if you have any suggestions, questions, or comments about this course.
General reading Those looking for an introduction may consult the Stanford Encyclopedia, which has a useful entry on Animalism.</description>
