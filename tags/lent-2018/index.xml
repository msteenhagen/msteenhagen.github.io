      <description>Course description The relation between causes and effects is typically taken to have a direction (it&amp;rsquo;s asymmetric). Whenever C is a cause of E, then E is not a cause of C. Moreover, this directionality seems aligned with both the temporal arrow and with patterns of practical deliberation. How do we explain this feature? Not all philosophical analyses of causation capture the concept of causal direction in the same way, if they capture it at all.</description>

Where and when Weeks 1-4, Friday 10-11, Lecture Block Room 7
Lecture 1: Realism This lecture introduces the discussion about realism. We can distinguish three forms realism can take: metaphysical, epistemological, and semantic.
