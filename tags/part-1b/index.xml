      <description>Course description These four lectures will talk about qualities. We will discuss the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, dispositional theories of colour, response-dependence concepts, the missing explanation argument, and a more simple view of colour or secondary qualities more generally.

      <description>Course description In these lectures I will discuss different philosophical views of the nature of perceptual experience, and analyze central objections.
Where and when Friday 3-4pm, Lecture Room 2 (Sidgwick Site Lecture Block)
Lecture 1: Naive realism Naive realism is the view that perceptual experience fundamentally is a presentation (to us) of familiar, mind-independent objects in our environment. It is motivated by the phenomenology of perception. Perception&amp;mdash;the Naive Realist maintains&amp;mdash;seems to be a presentation of those objects, and without a reason to think otherwise we can just take that appearance at face value.</description>
