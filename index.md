Maarten Steenhagen is a philosopher, writer and coffee lover studying perception and the mind. 

Currently he is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Centre of Philosophical Psychology](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/bence.nanay/paw.html) at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/). He holds Ph.D. from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy), and recently was a visiting researcher at the [University of Toronto](http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca).

In his current research, _Beyond the Senses_, he investigates perception by addressing structural questions about the nature of perceptual media and mediators, such as sounds, images, air, or transparent glass. 

His previous research project, [_Appearance and Representation_](http://msteenhagen.github.io/Appearance-and-representation/), offers a new approach to images. 

In June 2016 he organised the conference [_Perceiving at a Distance_]((http://www.newdirectionsproject.com/2015/09/14/distance/), funded by the [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com/) project at Cambridge University.
