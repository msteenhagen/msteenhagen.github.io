Maarten Steenhagen is a philosopher, writer, and coffee lover studying perception and the mind. 

He is a Research Fellow in the [Centre of Philosophical Psychology](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/bence.nanay/paw.html) at the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/). His Ph.D. is from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy) (2015), and in 2014-2015 he was a visiting researcher at the [University of Toronto](http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca).

In his current research, _Beyond the Senses_, he investigates perception by determining the role of perceptual media and mediators, such as sounds, images, and optical technology. His article '[False Reflections](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-016-0752-x)' recently appeared in _Philosophical Studies_. 

In June 2016 he organised the conference ['Perceiving at a Distance'](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com/2015/09/14/distance/), funded by the [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com/) project at Cambridge University, to investigate the varieties of distal sense perception.

His previous research project, [_Appearance and Representation_](http://msteenhagen.github.io/Appearance-and-representation/), shows how optical and acoustic artefacts expand perceptual capacities.
