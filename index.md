Maarten Steenhagen is a philosopher, writer and coffee lover known for his wild ideas about images.

He is a Research Fellow in [Bence Nanay](http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/bence.nanay/)'s group at the University of Antwerp. He has a Ph.D. in philosophy from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy), and recently was a visiting researcher at the [University of Toronto](http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca).

Maarten thinks and writes about current developments in philosophy of mind and perception, and the history of analytic philosophy.

His doctoral work, [_Appearance and Representation_](http://msteenhagen.github.io/Appearance-and-representation/), defends a new approach to images. 

The [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com/) project at Cambridge University just [awarded him a grant](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com/2015/09/14/distance/) to run a big conference on the distal senses, 'Perceiving at a distance'.

Maarten gives frequent [talks](http://msteenhagen.github.io/talks/). He can be reached via [email](mailto:maarten.steenhagen@uantwerp.be) or shouted at on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/msteenhagen).
