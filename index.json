In this lecture we will look at the distinction between properties and qualities, and consider empirical and conceptual arguments for delineating a class of \u0026lsquo;secondary\u0026rsquo; qualities as being more intimately tied than other qualities to our perspective or perceptual capacities.\n(Download handout here)\nSuggested Reading  Michael Ayers, ‘Primary and Secondary Qualities in Locke's Essay’ in Lawrence Nolan, ed., Primary and Secondary Qualities: The Historical and Ongoing Debate (Oxford: OUP, 2011), pp. 136-157.

One line of response tries to show that either there is no missing explanation, or the lack of explanation is innocent.
